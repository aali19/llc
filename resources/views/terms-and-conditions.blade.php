                        <p>We do not condone, encourage, or knowingly take part in plagiarism or any other acts of fraud
                            or dishonesty. We strongly adhere to and abide by all copyright laws, and will not knowingly

                            inappropriate, illegal, or otherwise wrongful use of the Products and/or other written

                        <h5>Our policy for using images</h5>

                        <p>We do not own the copyright of images unless specifically designed by our in-house
                            illustrators - hence we do not use copyright images by ourselves. We will simply provide you
                            links of recommended images so you can copy and place by yourself. You may use royalty free
                            images without any worry, however for copyright images you may require to pay the owner(s).
                        </p>

                        <h5>Refunds</h5>

                        <p>Kindly go through our refund policy to fully understand our clauses regarding the refund
                            procedure. <br /><br />Please be notified that We do not entertain refund requests if you
                            change your mind. Once an order is delivered you are no longer eligible to ask for 100%
                            refund. Once an Order has been started, the hours put into the project cannot be recuperated
                            and thus we will not provide a refund. The Products and Services offered are non-refundable
                            and come with no warranties, expressed or implied. However, you may ask for up to 3
                            revisions free of charge. In case you are not 100% satisfied with the quality of product/
                            services, you may ask for 50% refund against the paid fee amount. <br /><br /> We will
                            process the refund of 50% fee amount subject to verification of the quality concerns you
                            would claim. In case you have a special complaint scenario and demand full fee amount refund
                            then your case shall be forwarded to evaluation-committee and they will take an impartial
                            decision based upon facts and evidences.<br /><br /> Please be notified that you are NOT
                            eligible for 100% refund once an order is completed and delivered from the end of The Book
                            Writing. You may request for 3 revisions in total if the provided service does not meet your
                            expectations. You may file a partial refund request if ONLY we have your feedback in written
                            communication followed by disapproved revisions from your end. If you fail to produce any
                            such communication trail, The Book Writing won't entertain any refund claims.<br><br>In case
                            a customer submits a charge-back without approaching American Writing Solution for a refund or
                            to discuss the case with the account manager, the customer will become ineligible for a
                            refund after that and American Writing Solution reserves the right to not entertain the refund
                            request.</p>

                        <h5>Limitations on Revisions</h5>

                        <p>Editing Orders: We will revise edited content to ensure that no objective or technical errors
                            remain. If no objective or technical errors remain in the content, any further revisions to
                            that content are provided at the sole discretion of the Company.<br /><br />Writing Orders:
                            We will revise small segments of written material until that segment is approved by the
                            Client. Once the Client approves of the content that we develop, revisions to that content
                            will be billed at an appropriate editing rate. </p>

                        <h5>Limitation Of Liability</h5>

                        <p>You agree to release and hold the Company and its employees, officers, directors,

                            limited to: (a) telephone, electronic, hardware or software, network, Internet, email, or
                            computer malfunctions, failures or difficulties of any kind; (b) failed, incomplete, garbled
                            or delayed computer transmissions; (c) any condition caused by events beyond the control of
                            the Company that may cause the Product to be delayed, disrupted, or corrupted; (d) any
                            injuries, losses or damages of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of
                            utilizing our services; or (e) any printing or typographical errors in any materials
                            associated with our services. In addition, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold the
                            Company and Company’s Affiliates harmless from any claim, suit or demand, including
                            attorney’s fees, made by a third party due to or arising out of your utilizing of our
                            services, your violation or breach of these Terms and Conditions, your violation of any
                            rights of a third party, or any other act or omission by you.<br /><br />In no event shall
                            the Company be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, or
                            consequential damages arising out of or in any way connected with the use of this Website or
                            any information provided on this Website. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow
                            the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above
                            limitation may not apply to you.</p>

                        <h5>Amendments</h5>

                        <p>You acknowledge and agree that We may unilaterally change the Privacy policy and the Terms
