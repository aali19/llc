                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">Can’t put the experience of working with the expert writers of American Writing Solution into words!

                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">Sometimes all you need is an expert’s opinion on your manuscript. American Writing Solution’s team was that expert for me. They pointed out the most basic errors that I made which made me realize how big a mistake I was going to do had I not gotten my manuscript edited. They made me a better writer than before.</p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">American Writing Solution has been wonderful in editing my book. They are working in a very timely and responsive way. I appreciate the easy way of communicating with them via email, phone and texting. I had my book already written and so they are doing the editing, making suggestions and if I don't like them they are very amiable with my rejections. I really like working with them and have already recommended them to several other people.</p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">Their team consists of experts when it comes to book editing. I submitted all the material of my book and they responded in a timely manner, bringing out a completely professional version of my book that makes me look like a pro writer. Their team is extremely cooperative, making provided me edit suggestions with reasoning. The ones I rejected were not followed while the others were done and delivered on time. I liked the professional attitude of the team and will come back to them once I am able to complete my second book. Thank you American Writing Solution for the great experience.</p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">The folks who run this place are wonderful and a treasure of knowledge! I got bored during the pandemic and had an idea of writing a book but didn’t know how to start it. I was referred to get it written by the team of American Writing Solution and they did the best job possible. Loved their work and highly recommended.</p>

                  <h4>Kenneth Castellanos</h4>
                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">I wanted to write a book and started off with the idea. I was able to sketch my thoughts but wasn’t able to write something that even I would prefer to read. Just when I was about to lose hope, I came across an ad of American Writing Solution and thought of giving them a try. It was the best decision of my life. My book got ready and published and promoted. Everything the way I thought to do it but wasn’t able to do it myself. I recommend American Writing Solution for your books.</p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">I have written a total of two books myself and one with the help of a writing service but I wasn’t satisfied with the quality of their work so I wrote the book myself but it was missing the final look for which I searched for a nice editing service and luckily, was able to find one. I placed the order with them and the work that they provided was highly professional. I am extremely happy with the work that the trained editors of American Writing Solution have done for me.</p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">For me, the most important aspect of getting content done right is the timely delivery and constant support. These are what I received from American Writing Solution service. They completed the book tight on time when I requested it and their customer support team was always there to listen to me and assist me. Truly professionals.</p>

                  <h4>Marie Martinez</h4>
                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">Being a chef isn’t easy. I wanted to have my recipes exclusively known and for that, I opted to write a book. The only thing my book lacked was image editing and a good looking title image. This is when I found American Writing Solution and editing service. They proofread, corrected and formatted my book and edited the pictures that I had for the recipes. Their designers came up with such a colorful title page for my book that it makes my book stand out. I’m a happy chef now with my recipes to my name and part of the credit goes to American Writing Solution.</p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">If you are looking to get your book published and marketed well, these are the right people to do it. The folks at American Writing Solution did the very best in getting my book published to all the known book websites like Amazon books, Google books, etc and promoted it really well. I started receiving orders and have already sold over 10k copies. Loved their service.</p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">Great customer service is the key for client satisfaction in any business. As a marketer myself, I can vouch for that statement and American Writing Solution’s services are a true example of this. Their customer support is excellent and their writers got my marketing research converted into a book that has been attracting customers. Keep up the hard work</p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">My sister wanted to get her book out that she wrote for kids. I suggested her to get some colorful images along with the little stories to make it more attractive for the little ones and referred her to American Writing Solution Thank god that I was right and they delivered just the right thing, making the book more interesting. It’s the favorite book of even my little daughter, mostly because of the pictures.</p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">I needed a title image for my book and being a dog lover myself, I wanted to get my doggo’s most adorable picture on the title but felt something missing. Saw the ad of American Writing Solution on Facebook and booked an order for the title image, shared my dog’s picture with them. Their design team did what seemed to be an amazing job. I love the book title that they created. It gives my book the character that was missing from it. Give their service a try yourself and see what they are capable of doing.</p>
